Description: lock the screen for command execution
 Commandeer allows you to lock the active screen and run a command.
 They can be paused, started, and stopped by the user if chosen. A delay
 option is provided to schedule important system maintenance tasks (such
 as a backup) and allow the user to save their work before the command
 begins.

 while important tasks are running.
